<!-- Testimonials 

  “Tim’s professional confidentiality and knowledge of the Birkman gave me confidence in his ability to assess my test results. The examples and situations he used gave me greater clarity of why I feel and react the way I do in certain stressful or calm times in my life.” - Jasmine M. 

  "I strongly believe that the Birkman results are only as helpful as your investment in trying to understand them and how to apply them properly. The opportunity to review my results with someone else was truly invaluable. Tim's knowledge of how they all function together in their distinct ways helped me to gain great perspective on my past experiences and how to plan well for the future. I promise that it is worth your time and attention." - Alexandra S. 

"Having my Birkman read by Tim was influential in understanding myself at a greater depth. Tim was well prepared and professional; while also laid back and easy to talk to. His skilled question asking helped me connect the Birkman results to my daily life, which gave me words to better communicate what I experience and therefore I feel more known by those around me." - Eric C.
