              DiSC® is a personal assessment tool used by more than one million
              people every year to help improve teamwork, communication, and
              productivity in the workplace. DiSC® assessments are used in
              thousands of organizations around the world, from Fortune 500
              companies to nonprofits and small businesses. The assessment is
              based on the theory of psychologist William Moulton Marston
              published in 1928. It suggests four main personality types:
              Dominance (D), Influence (I), Steadiness (S), and
              Conscientiousness (C).

              The Birkman Method reports on both behavioral and occupational
              data and leverages a unique methodology for assessing personality
              through positive psychology. The goal of positive psychology is to
              help people live and flourish rather than merely exist, and is a
              “view within scientific psychology that aims to achieve a balanced
              and empirically grounded body of research on human nature and
              social relations” (Keyes & Haidt, 2003, p. 3).

              “Tim’s professional confidentiality and knowledge of the Birkman
              gave me confidence in his ability to assess my test results. The
              examples and situations he used gave me greater clarity of why I
              feel and react the way I do in certain stressful or calm times in
              my life.” - Jasmine M.
